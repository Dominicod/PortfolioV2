<center><h1>Info</h1></center>
 Fairly basic application that is built on top of ASP.NET MVC Core 7.0 with Xunit for Unit Tests. This application is a monolithic framework, I could have used a service orientated architecture however that would be incredibly overkill for this application. The database used by this application is PostgreSQL, mainly due to my familiarity with the technology.
